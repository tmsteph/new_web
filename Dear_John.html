    <p>Kristin told me you were looking to create a website.

I think it’s best to start small and build up from a working model. 

We can get a demo set up and running for you in a few weeks.


I’d say $300-$500 for the demo, paid when you are satisfied. 

After that, we can work at a rate of $35 per hour, paid weekly, depending on how much work is done.

After each payment, we will release a “new” version of the website, with the requested features and adjustments we worked on that week. 

Let me know how that sounds!
